The breast cancer histopathological image dataset (BreakHis) contains 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissues collected from 82 patients, regarded as malignant or benign. The tissues are magnigfied at different scaling factors (40X, 100X, 200X, 400X). In this dataset, it contains 2480 malignant and 5429 benign tumors. The images of tissues are taken to be 700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8 bit depth in each format, and in PNG. It is believed that this dataset can become a benchmark for future classifications of breast cancer classification.
